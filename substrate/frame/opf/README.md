# OPF Pallet
## Overview

The **OPF Pallet** handles the Optimistic Project Funding.
It allows users to nominate projects (whitelisted in OpenGov) with their DOT.
This mechanism will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation
and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them.
The project rewards distribution is handled by the **Distribution Pallet**
The voting round timeline is described below for someone voting for a project with no conviction round_0 and
for another project with a conviction of 1x in round_1:

```
|----------Voting_Round_0-----------|----------Voting_Round_1-----------|
|----user_votes----|--funds0_locked-|----user_votes----|--funds1_locked-|--funds1_locked-|
|------------------|--Distribution--|------------------|--Distribution--|

```

## Interface

### Dispatchable Functions

#### Public

These calls can be made from any externally held account capable of creating
a signed extrinsic.

**Basic actions:**
- `vote` - This extrinsic allows users to [vote for/nominate] a whitelisted project using their funds.
- `remove_vote` - This extrinsic allows users to remove a cast vote, as long as it is within the vote-casting period.
    The user can add a conviction to the amount appointed to the vote.
    With a conviction of x2 for example, one additional funds locking period will be added after the end of the round,
    as shown in the diagram above.
- `unlock_funds` - This extrinsic allows the user to unlock his funds, provided that the funds locking period has ended.
