//! OPF pallet.
//! 
//! The OPF Pallet handles the Optimistic Project Funding. 
//! It allows users to nominate projects (whitelisted in OpenGov) with their DOT. 
//! 
//! ## Overview
//! 
//! This mechanism will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation 
//! and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them. 
//! The project rewards distribution is handled by the Distribution Pallet.
//! 
//! ### Terminology
//! 
//! - **MaxWhitelistedProjects:** Maximum number of Whitelisted projects that can be handled by the pallet.
//! - **VoteLockingPeriod:** Period during which voting is disabled.
//! - **VotingPeriod:**Period during which voting is enabled.
//! - **TemporaryRewards:**For test purposes only ⇒ used as a substitute for the inflation portion used for the rewards.
//! 
//! ## Interface
//! 
//! ### Permissionless Functions
//! 
//! ### Privileged Functions
//! 
//! * `vote`: Allows users to [vote for/nominate] a whitelisted project using their funds.
//! * `remove_vote`: Allows users to remove a casted vote.
//! * `unlock_funds`: Allows users to unlock funds related to a specific project.
//!
